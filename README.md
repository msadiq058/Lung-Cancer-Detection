# Lung-Cancer-Detection
Dataset used for training and testing the model is a public dataset.<br/>
Link for dataset is https://www.dropbox.com/s/luhnutk30qyg3zd/LC25000.zip?dl=0 <br/>
This model is trained to identify from the images whether the images contains the cancer cells or not.
<br/>
# There are two versions of the model here
  1. A simple CNN model with image augumentation techniques. <br/>
      Training Accuracy : 94% (approx) <br/>
      Validation Accuracy: 95% (approx) <br/> <br/>
  2. A transfer learning model using Inception Network with Image augumentation techniques<br/>
      Training Accuracy : 98% (approx) <br/>
      Validation Accuracy: 98% (approx) <br/>
